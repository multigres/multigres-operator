# Runtime image promotion

The nightly compatibility workflow promotes runtime defaults only after a
scheduled canary on `multigres/multigres-operator`'s `main` branch passes. Proto
dependency sync does not change these defaults. Manual canaries are diagnostic;
they cannot publish a promotion PR or mark an upstream revision handled.

## Evidence and image mapping

Resolution selects a completed, successful scheduled upstream nightly build and
freezes the operator commit being tested. Preflight resolves immutable image
digests, checks for Linux amd64 and arm64 manifests, and verifies GitHub build
attestations against the upstream source SHA, `refs/heads/main`, the nightly
workflow identity, and the expected image repository. E2E then tests those exact
digests against the frozen operator commit.

After a successful canary, the promotion job commits
`config/runtime-image-promotion.json` with schema version 1, `upstream_sha`,
`operator_sha`, `nightly_run` and `canary_run` (IDs, attempts, and URLs), and an
`images` map containing the three fully qualified digest references. This file is
created by the first successful promotion; it is not seeded with untested images.

The same Git commit updates these constants in `api/v1alpha1/image_defaults.go`:

| Image | Defaults |
| --- | --- |
| `pgctld` | `DefaultPostgresImage` |
| `multigres` | `DefaultMultiadminImage`, `DefaultMultiorchImage`, `DefaultMultipoolerImage`, `DefaultMultigatewayImage` |
| `multiadmin-web` | `DefaultMultiadminWebImage` |

Etcd and Postgres exporter defaults are preserved. The PR describes the current
main and proposed images and links both build and test evidence.

## PR lifecycle and retries

Promotion maintains one open PR from `chore/promote-runtime-images` to `main`.
It uses the existing `MULTIGRES_BOT_APP_ID` and
`MULTIGRES_BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, scoped to contents and pull requests on the
operator repository. The App token ensures branch pushes and PR creation trigger
CI. Promotion PR CI validates the record and runs e2e against the committed PR
head without runtime image overrides. Local `make pull-e2e-images` uses the same
compiled defaults, including the Postgres exporter. When the reusable workflow
checks out an older framework that still loads `testutil.MultigresImages`, it
also pulls that revision's legacy list so empty and partial overrides remain
usable. Current frameworks pull only the compiled set.

Review the PR and require those checks before merging; promotion never merges
automatically.

The promotion script checks both main's record and any pending branch record for
stale revisions. Before the first record exists, it also compares the nightly
against the source revisions in the existing pinned image tags. It refuses to publish if operator main moved since the canary,
the upstream revision is stale/divergent, or an already recorded source revision
has a different digest set. Newer green sets replace all images and evidence in
one tree/ref update, retaining branch ancestry without a force push. Reprocessing
an identical set leaves its commit and original evidence unchanged.

Compatibility reporting and promotion are sibling terminal jobs. Reporting has
only `issues: write`; promotion has only `contents: write` and
`pull-requests: write`. A green canary can close the compatibility incident even
if promotion fails. Promotion errors fail the workflow without opening a
compatibility incident.

Only successful PR publication (or verification that the same set is already
published/merged) writes the `nightly-compatibility-promoted-<sha>` checkpoint.
Resolution reads these checkpoints only from successful scheduled runs on main;
older green-only artifacts do not count. A failed promotion remains eligible for
the next scheduled run. A failed PR API call may leave the complete candidate
commit on the promotion branch; retry repairs PR publication before writing the
checkpoint. No partially updated image set can become visible on the branch.

## Local validation

```sh
node --test scripts/promote-runtime-images.test.js scripts/nightly-compatibility.test.js scripts/e2e-images.test.js
go test -tags=e2e ./test/e2e/framework -count=1
actionlint .github/workflows/nightly-compatibility.yaml .github/workflows/pull-request.yaml .github/workflows/_reusable-e2e.yaml
```

On a generated promotion branch, also run
`node scripts/promote-runtime-images.js --check` to check the record against all
six committed constants. Full canary and promotion e2e execution takes place in
GitHub Actions with registry access and a disposable Kind cluster.
